    "3.When using K-Means, describe two strategies for selecting the appropriate number of clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS-\n",
    "1 -Elbow method: This method involves plotting the within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS) against the number of clusters. WCSS is a measure of the variability within each cluster, and it decreases as the number of clusters increases. At some point, adding more clusters will only result in a marginal decrease in WCSS. The elbow method involves selecting the number of clusters at the point where the WCSS starts to level off, forming an elbow shape. This point represents the optimal number of clusters where adding more clusters does not lead to a significant improvement in the clustering performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "2 -Silhouette method: This method involves calculating the silhouette score for different values of k, where k is the number of clusters. The silhouette score measures how well each data point fits into its assigned cluster and ranges from -1 to 1. A high silhouette score indicates that a data point is well-matched to its cluster, while a low score indicates that the data point may be better suited to a different cluster. The silhouette method involves selecting the number of clusters that maximizes the average silhouette score across all data points. This approach provides a more nuanced evaluation of the clustering performance than the elbow method, as it takes into account both the cohesion and separation of the clusters."

This approach can lead to more accurate and personalized recommendations over time, as the system learns more about each user's individual preferences.\n",
