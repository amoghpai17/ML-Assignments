    "In machine learning, a target function is a function that maps input variables to an output variable. It represents the underlying relationship between input and output that a model tries to learn from the training data. The goal of the model is to approximate the target function as closely as possible in order to make accurate predictions on new, unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "A real-life example of a target function could be predicting housing prices based on features such as location, size, number of rooms, and age of the property. The target function in this case would be a mathematical function that takes these input variables and outputs a predicted price.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fitness of a target function is typically assessed using a loss function, which measures the difference between the predicted output of the model and the actual output in the training data. The model tries to minimize this loss function by adjusting its parameters through an optimization process such as gradient descent. The lower the loss function, the better the model is at approximating the target function, and the more accurate its predictions will be on new data."

    "1 - Accuracy: This measures the proportion of correct predictions out of the total number of predictions. It is calculated as (true positives + true negatives) / total predictions.

    "\n",
    "The most common reason for underfitting is that the model is not complex enough to capture the relationships between the input variables and the output variable. This can happen if the model has too few parameters, or if the parameters are not tuned properly. Another reason for underfitting can be insufficient data, where the model does not have enough examples to learn the patterns in the data.\n",

    "ii. What does it mean to overfit? When is it going to happen?\n",
    "\n",
    "In machine learning, overfitting occurs when a model is too complex and is fitting the training data too closely. This can lead to poor generalization performance on new, unseen data, as the model is too specialized to the training data and cannot generalize well to new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overfitting typically happens when the model is too complex relative to the amount of training data available.

Metrics such as silhouette score, Calinski-Harabasz index, or Davies-Bouldin index can be used to evaluate clustering performance.\n",
    "2 - Reconstruction error: If the unsupervised learning model is a reconstruction-based algorithm such as autoencoder or PCA, the success can be evaluated based on how well the model is able to reconstruct the input data from the learned representation. The reconstruction error measures the difference between the original data and the reconstructed data.\n",
    "3 - Visual inspection: In some cases, the success of an unsupervised learning model can be evaluated through visual inspection of the learned representation or the output of the algorithm. For example, if the unsupervised learning model is used for dimensionality reduction or feature extraction, the learned representation can be visualized and inspected to see if it captures meaningful patterns or structure in the data."

For example, a classification model may be used to predict whether an email is spam or not spam based on the content of the email. In this case, the output of the model would be a binary label indicating whether the email is spam or not.\n",

    "On the other hand, a regression model is designed to predict continuous numerical outputs. This means the output of the model is a continuous value that can take any numerical value within a certain range.

In this case, the output of the model would be a continuous numerical value indicating the predicted price of the house.\n",

This process is repeated ten times, with each fold being used as the testing set once. The results are then averaged to give an overall estimate of the model's performance.

Examples of hyperparameters include the learning rate in neural networks or the regularization strength in linear models. Adjusting the hyperparameters can be done manually by testing different values and evaluating the model's performance, or it can be automated using techniques such as grid search or random search.
