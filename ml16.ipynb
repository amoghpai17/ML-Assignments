    "Ridge regression is a technique used in linear regression analysis to address multicollinearity, which occurs when independent variables in a multiple regression model are highly correlated with each other. In the presence of multicollinearity, the standard regression model becomes unstable and yields unreliable coefficient estimates.\n",

The penalty term is added to the sum of squared residuals in the regression equation, and the resulting equation is minimized to estimate the regression coefficients.\n",

    "Similar to Ridge regression, Lasso regression introduces a penalty term to the regression equation to shrink the coefficients towards zero and improve the stability of the model. However, in Lasso regression, the penalty term is the sum of the absolute values of the regression coefficients (i.e., L1 regularization), while in Ridge regression, it is the sum of the squared values of the regression coefficients (i.e., L2 regularization).\n",

This results in a smaller set of variables that have a stronger predictive power.\n",

The goal of logistic regression is to predict the probability of the binary outcome based on the values of the independent variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "In logistic regression, the dependent variable (also called the response variable) is a binary variable that takes on only two values, typically 0 and 1. The independent variables (also called predictors or covariates) can be continuous, categorical, or a mixture of both.\n",
