    "ANS-\n",
    "The estimated depth of a Decision Tree trained on a one million instance training set can vary greatly depending on the complexity of the data and the parameters used for the tree. However, in general, an unrestricted Decision Tree trained on such a large dataset could have a very deep tree, potentially hundreds or thousands of levels deep.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, without any restrictions on the tree depth, it is possible that the tree could become very large and overfit the training data, resulting in poor generalization to new, unseen data. Therefore, it is common to use techniques such as pruning, regularization, or limiting the maximum depth of the tree to prevent overfitting and improve performance on new data."

    "The Gini impurity of a node in a decision tree can be either lower or higher than that of its parent, depending on the characteristics of the data being split.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a node is split into child nodes, the Gini impurity of the child nodes is calculated based on the distribution of the classes in the child nodes. If the split results in a more homogeneous distribution of classes in the child nodes, then the Gini impurity will decrease compared to the parent node. Conversely, if the split results in a more heterogeneous distribution of classes, then the Gini impurity will increase.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, if the decision tree is well-designed and the data is well-behaved, we would expect the Gini impurity of child nodes to be lower than the parent node because the tree is recursively splitting the data into smaller, more homogeneous subsets. However, in some cases, a split may result in a higher Gini impurity due to noise or outliers in the data."

    "ANS-\n",
    "If a decision tree is overfitting the training set, it can be a good idea to reduce the maximum depth of the tree to prevent further overfitting and improve the model's generalization performance on new, unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a decision tree is overfitting, it means that the tree has learned the noise in the training data, and the model's performance on new data is likely to be worse. Reducing the maximum depth of the tree can help to simplify the model and remove unnecessary complexity, which can help to reduce overfitting and improve generalization performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "By reducing the maximum depth of the tree, we can limit the number of splits and prevent the tree from becoming too deep and complex. This can help to ensure that the model captures the most important patterns in the data without memorizing the noise in the training set.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it's worth noting that reducing the maximum depth too much can lead to underfitting, where the model is too simple and unable to capture the underlying patterns in the data. Therefore, it's important to find the right balance between model complexity and generalization performance by tuning the model's hyperparameters, such as the maximum depth of the tree, on a validation set."

    "However, we can make a rough estimate by assuming that the time required to train a decision tree on a larger dataset is roughly proportional to the size of the dataset.
