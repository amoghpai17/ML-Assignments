    "Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where an algorithm learns from labeled data to make predictions or decisions about new, unseen data. In supervised learning, the algorithm is provided with a set of input-output pairs, where the input is the data that the algorithm needs to make predictions on, and the output is the desired outcome for that input. The algorithm then uses this labeled data to learn a mapping function that can predict the output for new, unseen inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The significance of the name \"supervised learning\" is that the algorithm is supervised or guided by the labeled data during the learning process. The algorithm is essentially learning from a teacher, who provides the correct answers for the inputs. This is in contrast to unsupervised learning, where the algorithm is not provided with labeled data and has to find patterns and relationships in the data on its own. Supervised learning is particularly useful in applications such as image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and predictive modeling, where the desired output is known and can be used to train the algorithm."
